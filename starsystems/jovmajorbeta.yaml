intro_text: TRAPPIST-1 is a star system located about 39 light-years from Earth. It
  is the first known star system to have seven Earth-sized planets orbiting within
  its habitable zone. The planets are all very close to each other, and they are thought
  to be tidally locked to their star, meaning that the same side of each planet always
  faces the star.
