# pyCaptainsLog

## Introduction
CLI based text adventure where you explore procedurally generated star systems.

### Example Gameplay

Locations, connections, dialogue and combat are all procedurally generated!

Content within each star system is generated via Google's Generative AI (Gemini).

### Important!
You **must** set your env variable for your API key in order to use Gemini, e.g. `export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_secret_api_key`
