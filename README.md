# Introduction
CLI based text adventure where you explore procedurally generated star systems.

Locations and connections are procedurally generated.

Content within each star system is generated via Google's Generative AI (Gemini).

You must set your env variable for your API key, e.g. `export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_secret_api_key`
More detailed instructions for using Google's Gemini API: https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/python_quickstart

Note: This project is not affiliated with Google. This current revision uses Gemini to produce text for the star systems and is subject to change.
